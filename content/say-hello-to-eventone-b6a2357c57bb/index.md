We have two announcements!

-   We are rebranding as eventOne
-   We are re-incorporating as a Delaware C-Corp (eventOne, Inc.)

But there is more! Drum roll, please….

This rebrand and reincorporation signal a major shift in our focus: **we are now an event technology company.**

In early 2018, we were looking for direction as a company. A mission. We wanted to focus on one product rather than being a consulting company. Around the middle of the year, we had just onboarded our third client for a custom conference app. And it was right there in front of us. We were already (sort of) building it: An event management & planning tool! We immediately started to focus on and throw around ideas. Anything from event registration to recordings hosting to planning tools. And then, we started building.

> Finally, we have a focus. A direction. And a mission: to make event planning easier, more collaborative, and more intuitive.

We want to make information easy to find. And change. Take an event’s schedule for instance. Whenever it changes, it has to change in a LOT of places. What if it only needed to be changed in one place? In one central location that updates it everywhere. That is only one piece of our vision.

Our main vision is to build one platform to manage every aspect of event planning and management. Everything from managing attendees or vendors to planning the schedule to finding a venue. That is where the name eventOne comes from. It will take us a long time to reach this vision but that is our goal.

The first step to fulfill our vision is event registration software. And we already built and launched it. You can check out a real life example [here](https://event1.io/e/michn/inch-19/). Our primary goals when building e1 Registration were simplicity with flexibility. The first version is very minimal but as we improve the software, we will add more flexibility and integration with our event apps.

We are excited to show you what else we have up our sleeves for 2019!

If you are interested in a mobile event app or registration software, please [get in touch](mailto:sales@event1.io) with us. We would love to help you out!
