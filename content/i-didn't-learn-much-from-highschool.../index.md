And why I’m not going to college. 

I’m a “do-er.” I don’t learn well by studying books and answering arbitrary questions about the topic I’m trying to learn. Instead, I learn by doing. As I’m getting close to completing highschool and looking at the next step, I’m coming to realize that the school I did was not so much what taught me what I know.
