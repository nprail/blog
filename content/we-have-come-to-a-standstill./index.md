4:12 productions has discovered reality: man plans, but God establishes. Unfortunately, we don’t always plan according to God’s design, so our intents crumble when tested by God’s power. Our recent endeavor, project CIC, has faced this power of God, so we have disappointing news.

### Members Move On

Of the team members, only I am interested in pursuing a filmmaking career. I knew the team would eventually dissolve, but it occurred sooner than I anticipated. _My_ plan was for CIC to be the final 4:12 Productions film created by the current group, but plans change, especially when working with a team. As many of our production staff leave to plan their future after high school graduation, I know God has ultimate control, and 4:12 Productions will be used in the proper time and place, with the right people. Whatever He has planned is better than my plan ever could be.

### Focus Shifts

Currently, I have two large priorities consuming my time: school and work. I plan to finish high school by December 2018, which lightens my schedule, but I founded a tech startup which has become profitable, so that absorbs my spare time. Film is not _easily_ lucrative, so my focus is with the company as I approach adulthood and need steady income.

### The Silence of Standstill

Progress on project CIC has halted, but, I am not giving up on it. The story is too authentic to be abandoned! However, the release of project CIC is indefinitely postponed. This film is monumental, one which requires undivided attention, which I _cannot_ currently provide.

### Conclusion

While CIC is temporarily shelved, even shelved items resurface in the proper time and place. I attended the Christian Worldview Film Festival this year, where God revealed to me that I rushed this project. I set my own plan, but He had different intentions. **“The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.”** Proverbs 16:9. We as youth can be ambitions. We can be full of life, plans, and hope, but even in our excitement, we must remember our duty: **“Set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.”** 1 Timothy 4:12b
