Here at Filiosoft, we have recently been discussing our branding, vision, and who we are as a company. We currently have very little brand and our website doesn’t really make it clear what we actually do and who we are. Part of that is because we haven’t really known exactly what we do until recently. In light of all that, I decided that I wanted to give a bit of an introduction and brief history of our company. I want to make it clear who we are and what we do.

### Our History

First, I would like to give a brief history of Filiosoft. Starting all the way at the beginning.

---

### 2015

In early 2015, I was starting to become a fairly decent developer. And at 15 years old I was ambitious. I wanted to start making money with my development skills. I had previously made a few decent web apps for free including one for my church. With some experience under my belt, I decided to start a company. Back then, I called it “Prail Freelancing” because I was pretty much a freelancer.

In fall 2015, we got our first paying customer! We built a mobile app for the Indiana Association of Home Educators (IAHE) for their conference. Of course, at this point, “we” was just me. I quickly realized how big the project was so I on-boarded another developer, Caleb Higginbotham, who became my business partner. But we didn’t have a good name yet.

### 2016

In January, I finally came up with a good name for the company! We called it Filiosoft. The Latin word _filios_ combined with soft (short for software). Filios means children. In relation to [Galatians 3:26](https://www.bible.com/bible/72/GAL.3.26):

> for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. - HCSB

On January 24th, 2016, we purchased the domain [filiosoft.com](https://filiosoft.com)!

In the Spring, we released the first version of IAHE’s app for the conference. It was decent but it still needed a lot of work.

---

### 2017

Fast forward to 2017, nothing much has happened. We continued to improve the IAHE app. I started contributing to open source and we launched a few small open source projects including a GitLab Slack bot and a few utilities.

In Spring, we got our second paying customer! Michigan’s Information Network for Christian Homes (INCH) also wanted a conference app. So we built one for them as well, using a lot of what we learned from IAHE’s app.

After finding that maintaining two separate code bases for apps that were basically the same is really difficult, we decided to start working on making the apps scalable and modular. We are continuing to work on that effort even now. Although it is nearing completion.

On April 24th, 2017, we [formed Filiosoft, LLC](https://fsft.us/llc) and became a legal entity! This was a huge step for us as we began to take our business more seriously.

Late 2017 and into 2018 we also did some contract work for a client building some custom software. This gave us a nice boost in income.

### 2018

In 2018 we started structuring ourselves more like an actual company. We signed an operating agreement (way later than we should have) and we started planning for the future. We realized that we needed some sort of sustainable, recurring revenue. At this point our revenue was all over the place and inconsistent. We decided to make our conference app platform into our main product. That brings the history to now, halfway through 2018. We just launched our 3rd conference app which is the first one that uses our new CONVA (short for convention apps) Platform. We are continuing our effort to make our conference apps a scalable platform and that effort is getting close to paying off!

### So what do we do?

We build CONVA Platform, a conference app SaaS platform. Our goal is to make it easy and affordable for organizations to have a mobile schedule app for their conferences. We are also looking into expanding the platform to more areas of conference management. CONVA Platform is currently in the MVP stage.

### What do we build with?

JavaScript. JavaScript. And more JavaScript. Did I mention JavaScript? Our backend is written in [Node.js](https://medium.com/@nodejs), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [MongoDB](https://medium.com/@MongoDB). On the frontend we primarily use [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) but we are starting to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) more. For our mobile apps, we use [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). You can find a full list of the tools we use on [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/eventone).

### Conclusion

We are a young company started by two kids at the time but we are now finding our direction and market fit. We are developing not only software but our long-term vision for what we want this company to be.
