2018 was an interesting year for me. Looking back on the year, I realize that it was a year of doors closing. But also of doors opening. It was very much a year of waiting. 

I had a lot of goals for 2018. From studying the Bible more to making another film to growing Filiosoft (now eventOne) into a steady income. I did not meet many of those goals. Another [film was not made](https://s.nprail.me/dxtrTW) and I’m not paying myself at all this year with eventOne (more on that later). 

But I did complete one major goal. And that was finishing high school! Well, technically that happened on the 20th of last month (January 2019) but I still consider it to be a success, largely, of 2018. And that leads to what kind of year I think 2019 will be for me: a year of change. 

I am no longer a student. Filiosoft, LLC is now eventOne, Inc. I now have a paid internship. And so on. And that is just in the first month of the year! 

This year I have just a few personal and professional goals. The biggest goal I have is to spend more quality time with my friends and family. The second biggest is to go full time on eventOne by the end of the year. That goal is a stretch but we’ll see.
