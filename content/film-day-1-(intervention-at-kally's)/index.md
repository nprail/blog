We finished our first shoot day this Wednesday (Jul 20)! This year we are doing a modern scene unlike previous years so we filmed in a restaurant. A HUGE thanks to Costas Stylianou for allowing us to take over half of Lincoln Square Pancake House in Greenfield, Indiana for a day! We didn’t get done nearly as much as we wanted to but it was a good day. We had a lot of new crew and cast.

Now, we thought you might want to see some photos so here they are!
