We have made two films so far. [The Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc2a-YvxHdQ) and more recently, [A Rebellion Born](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqgg980biGk). Both were for a video contest in which A Rebellion Born [won second place](http://arrethtrae.com/page45.html). We are, once again, participating in that video contest but we need your help. Making films costs quite a bit. We need to feed our cast and crew, pay for costumes, and pay for editing software. That is where you come in. We are doing this campaign to help pay for that. Our initial goal is $500 but the more we get the better the quality can be.

To donate go here: [https://www.gofundme.com/412film2016](https://www.gofundme.com/412film2016). If you can’t financially help, please share it with anyone you know. We greatly appreciate your support! It helps us to continue to make films to the glory of God. Thanks in advance for supporting is!

1 Timothy 4:12:  
  
Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
