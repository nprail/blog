We have some big announcements! 

First, we are reincorporating as a Deleware C-Corp. Secondly, we are rebranding as eventOne. And finally, this rebrand and reincorporation signal a major shift in our focus: we are now an event technology company. 

In early 2018, we were looking for direction. A mission. We wanted to focus on one core product. Around the middle of the year, we had just onboarded our third client for a custom conference app. And it was right there in front of us. We were already (sorta) building it: An event management & planning tool! We immediately started throwing around ideas. Anything from event registration to recordings hosting to planning tools. 

Finally, we have a focus. A direction. And a mission: to make event planning easier, more collaborative, and more intuitive. 

We want to make information easy to find. And update. Take an event’s schedule for instance. Whenever it changes, it has to change in a LOT of places. What if it only needed to be changed in one place, though? One central location. That is part of our vision. 

The first step in this mission is registration. And we already built it.
