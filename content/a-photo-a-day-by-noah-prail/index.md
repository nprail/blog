## January 28th, 2017 through January 28th, 2018

![](./asset-1.jpeg)

I have decided that I will be taking 1 photo (at least) per day during 2017 and posting them on social media. I have heard that it helps a lot with learning photography and cinematography. You will be able to find my photos on my Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ (links below).

#### Why Start on January 28th Not on New Years Day?

I was extremely busy during the first week of January so I was unable to begin. So I decided to start on the Chinese New Year instead.

#### Camera

Most photos are taken with either my phone, a Google Nexus 5X, or a Canon Rebel T5i. I have a 55–300mm, 50mm, and 18–55mm lens.
